### Version 7.3.5.1

* **Bindings are now saved separately for each spec.** When you switch to a spec
  that does not yet have a profile, a new profile will be created by copying the
  previous spec's profile; any changes you make will apply *only* to the current
  spec. If you want to rebind a shared spell, you will have to do so separately
  for each spec.
* Fixed a potential "action blocked" issue caused by tainting the spellbook
